# 5 Weird Cat Behaviours Explained

![Curious Cat](https://placecats.com/800/401)

Cats do the strangest things. Here are 5 odd behaviours and why they happen:

1. **Chattering at birds**  
   - Excitement mixed with frustration or mimicking prey sounds.

2. **Kneading your lap**  
   - Kitten behaviour from nursing; it’s comfort.

3. **Zoomies at 3AM**  
   - Built-up energy released in short bursts.

4. **Head butting you**  
   - Marking you with their scent as a sign of affection.

5. **Staring at nothing**  
   - They may see tiny movements or sounds we can’t perceive.

Your cat isn’t broken – they’re just being a cat.
