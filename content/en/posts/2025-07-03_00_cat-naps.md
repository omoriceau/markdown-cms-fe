Have you ever wondered why your cat sleeps so much? On average, cats sleep 12-16 hours a day, with some reaching up to 20 hours!

## Why do they sleep so much?

- Sleep helps them regulate mood and health.
- Even indoor cats retain these instincts.

Next time your feline is snoozing, remember: theyâ€™re just recharging for their next burst of chaos.
