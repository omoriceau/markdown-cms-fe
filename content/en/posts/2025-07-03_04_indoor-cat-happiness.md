![Happy Cat](https://placecats.com/800/404)

Indoor cats live longer, but they need mental stimulation to stay happy.

## Top tips:

- Provide climbing structures and scratching posts.
- Play interactive games daily (feather wands, laser toys).
- Offer puzzle feeders for mental enrichment.
- Give them window perches to watch the world outside.
- Rotate toys weekly to maintain novelty.

A bored cat becomes a destructive cat. Keep them engaged for a healthier life.
