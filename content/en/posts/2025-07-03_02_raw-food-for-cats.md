# Should You Feed Your Cat Raw Food?

![Cat Eating](https://placecats.com/800/402)

The raw feeding trend has reached cats. But is it safe?

## Pros:

- Mimics their natural diet.
- Potentially shinier coat and better teeth health.

## Cons:

- Risk of bacterial contamination (Salmonella, E. coli).
- Imbalanced nutrition if not formulated correctly.

**Verdict:** Consult your vet before switching to raw food. What works for one cat might harm another.
